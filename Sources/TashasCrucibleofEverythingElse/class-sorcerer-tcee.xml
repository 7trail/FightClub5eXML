        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Spellslinger (TCEE)</name>
        <text>Some creatures are born with an innate connection to the Weave and can use their own bodies as a spellcasting focus. These sorcerers often find their abilities well suited to life in the wild frontier or as clandestine agents for powerful organizations.

Any number of factors can bestow this gift upon a creature. Known spellslingers often cite events such as the following for their gifts: surviving a magical cataclysm, a blessing of a powerful fey monarch, an ancestor's bargain with an otherworldly being, or sheer dumb luck.

You can use only one Sling or Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
