		<text>You summon the protective presence of a Celestial spirit, which manifests as a pillar of divine light that shines in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Bright Light fills the Cylinder, and when you Move on your turn, you can also move the Cylinder up to 30 feet.</text>
		<text>	When a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can bathe that creature in one of the following lights:</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Healing Light. The creature that isn't an Undead or a Construct regains Hit Points equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting modifier. A creature can be healed by this light only once per casting of this spell.</text>
		<text>Searing Radiance. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d12 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>	At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of level 8 or higher, the healing and damage increase by 1d12 for each slot level above 7.</text>
