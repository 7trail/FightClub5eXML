		<text>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a throw of the Net at a creature within 15 feet of yourself. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier. The target succeeds automatically if it's Huge or larger.</text>
		<text>	On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until it escapes the Net. To escape, the target must use its action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, escaping on a success. A creature within 5 feet of the target can use its action to attempt the same thing. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; immunity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.</text>
