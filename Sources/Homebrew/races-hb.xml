      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Intelligent and curious beings, Smutsia are eager to explore and figure out all sorts of things. Smutsia are mammals and can at most birth one child a year. When a Smutsia is approaching maturity, it is sent ut to explore more of the world and find new places to live. All Smutsia are monogamous and have one partner for life, which they may have many children with over their lifetime. 

Having lived mostly in burrows and explored during the night, most Smutsia are somewhat afraid of direct sunlight as they don't know what it might do to them.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Changelings are a humanoid race of shapechangers who conceal their true identities behind false faces. Their gifts of mimicry allow them to appear as members of any humanoid culture, playing the part of a dwarf one day and a dragonborn the next. Although changelings can adopt any guise, most rely on a few established personas, each with a developed history and a network of friends and acquaintances.

    <trait>
      <name>Divergent Persona</name>
      <text>You can gain proficiency with one skill of your choice and one tool or weapon of your choice. Define a unique identity associated with each of those proficiencies; establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details. While you are in the form of this persona, the related proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one or both of these proficiencies with a different proficiency of the same kind. For each proficiency you replace in this way, you must also replace the associated persona with a different one associated with the new proficiency.

      <name>Shapechanger</name>
      <text>As an action, you can reshape your body into a Medium or Small creature, or you can revert to your true form. A creature you take the form of can be one you have seen, or one from your imagination. Your form has no bearing on your game statistics. No matter what form you take, no more than two of your appendages can function as hands.

While you have a humanlike shape, you can wear clothing and armor made for a Humanoid of your size. When you transform, any equipment you are wearing or carrying that can't be worn or carried by the new form falls to the ground in your space.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The bane of dungeon delvers across the multiverse, few adventurers would suspect that the things in their nightmares might be sitting across the campfire. Only a handful of mimics ever learn to take a humanoid form, and those that do often live a very lonely existence. However, hope is never completely absent. Adventuring makes for strange company, and the bonds that form between companions are far stronger than any adhesive mucus.
