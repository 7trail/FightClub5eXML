      <text>Corvums are a crow-like race with dark feathers and sharp minds. Their reputation in birdfolk society is nothing short of villainous, and they are regularly cast as the antagonists of any given situation. It’s hard to say whether the corvums are distrusted because they behave the way they do, or if they behave the way they do because they are distrusted.

As a dusk corvum, you are more at home in the bustle of society than in the wilds of the forest. You understand subtle social cues the way a hunter understands their prey, and you're just as quick to capitalize on an advantage.

      <name>For Personal Gain</name>
      <text>It is widely believed that corvums only look out for themselves. Sometimes this presents as flexible morals, and at other times it simply means they follow a personal code instead of subscribing to general law. Either way, corvums are a crafty race and they tend to get what they want, one way or another.

Corvums are typically found in positions with a modicum of power, such as advisors or minor officials. The stigma they face usually prevents them from attaining too prominent a position in birdfolk society, but corvums are adept at working behind the scenes, spreading their influence subtly and to great effect.

      <text>Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.

As a sable luma, you are often found on the fringes of social situations. While you are overlooked by the crowd, your gifts are undeniable. You are destined for greatness.

      <text>To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.

These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.

      <text>While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.

Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.

      <text>Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.

As a sera luma, you are revered and celebrated by those around you. You have an almost unnatural beauty and grace, inspiring admiration in some and jealousy in others.

      <name>Touched</name>
      <text>To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.

These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.

      <text>While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.

Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.

When falling you can use your reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you are encumbered.

As a grove cervan, you are swift and agile, able to quickly maneuver out of harm's way. You are also incredibly versatile, and can fulfill a variety of roles within a village or an adventuring party.

Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation.

      <name>Wary and Practical</name>
      <text>One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.

The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans' greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one's options. The best cervan leaders favor this approach.

      <name>The Sight</name>
      <text>Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as "The Sight", this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as "The Sighted", and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.

A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren't always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.

      <text>The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk, hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behavior stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Sensitive and Kind</name>
      <text>Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.

Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.

One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>One With the Forest</name>
      <text>Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.

Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.
</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Dressed for Comfort</name>
      <text>Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge's clothing.

Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge's needs.
