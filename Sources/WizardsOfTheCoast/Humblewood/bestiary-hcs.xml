    <description>Ashsnakes are huge monstrosities which resemble snakes molded from volcanic magma. Their bodies seeth with an internal heat below the charcoal-gray scales that cover their forms. While the blazing light emanating from their empty eye sockets makes it appear as though ashsnakes can see, they rely entirely on vibrations to assess their surroundings.

Mysterious Origins:
Little is known about the origins of the ashsnake. They recently emerged from beneath the ashen plains of the Scorched Grove and appear to have an insatiable hunger. Ashnakes use the mounds of ash and dust in the Grove to conceal their presence, allowing them to close in on unwary prey and ambush them. While not particularly intelligent, ashsnakes possess predatorial cunning and survival instincts eerily reminiscent of the fauna that inhabited the Grove before its burning.

Sightless Worms:
Ashsnakes have no ability to detect sights and sounds in a traditional sense. They are, however, adept at sensing even the smallest vibration, and the slightest footfall is enough to draw their attention. Some scholars believe it may be possible to "disappear" from an ashsnakes "vision" by standing perfectly still, but finding volunteers to confirm this theory has understandably proven difficult.

“Beneath the ash it lies in wait. A hiss, a snap, and it’s too late.”
- From The Epic of Fire, a centuries old poem.

    <description>The aspect of fire is an elemental creature of fire and molten rock, whose gargantuan frame could easily be mistaken for a small mountain. The aspect is not only a creature of heat and energy, but also of destruction and rage, and it appears to draw strength from the forests its flames consume.

Primal Incarnation:
A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the "being of fire and destruction" said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood.

Stirring in its Slumber:
The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.

The aspect's essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove's nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.

Unnatural Life
Animated skeletons are common among the practitioners of the necromantic arts. Even at the Avium, where necromancy is forbidden in practice, it is taught in theory. A common exception is the use of animated skeletons for menial tasks around the college. The reanimation of birdfolk who did not give their express consent in life is seen as a violation of their memory, so these skeletons usually consist of former college staff who desired to stay and help long past their own time. Not all scholars agree that even this relatively benign form of necromancy should be allowed, while others don't see why permission from the dead should be necessary, believing that "dead is dead". Though the consent policy remains in place, heady debates over the ethics of certain forms of necromancy have resulted in the shunning of more morally flexible scholars.

    <description>Cobblefrights are undead monstrosities created through dark necromancy. Rumored to have been originally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night's Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus' research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.

Horror of Horrors
Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them.

Chaotic Psyche
The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.

    <description>Curious and gentle creatures, these tiny bats have ashen fur and noses which sport a small candle-sized flame.

Winged Fire
Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.

Colonies of Combustion
Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.

Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away.

Fine Familiars
Throughout Humblewood's history, the docile nature of the emberbats have made them ideal familiars or animal companions, especially to masters who journey into dark places.

When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away.

Fine Familiars
Throughout Humblewood's history, the docile nature of the emberbats have made them ideal familiars or animal companions, especially to masters who journey into dark places.

    <description>Forest prowlers feature prominently throughout folktales in Humblewood, notably as monsters in frightful stories. These cat-like beasts have the unique ability to grow leaves and moss on their spotted fur, allowing them to camouflage perfectly within the forest canopy.

Fable and Folklore
One of the reasons forest prowlers have attained such mythic status is due to their elusive nature. They are adept at moving unseen through the canopy where they hunt, and their skills as ambush predators means that few who see them live to tell the tale. In some communities the killing of a forest prowler is considered a rite of passage among beast hunters. The large fangs seen adorning the necks of Humblewood's greatest hunters and warriors, and cloaks made from prowler fur, are trophies that showcase one's prowess and skill.

Fierce Hunter
Forest prowlers are apex predators. They can claim virtually any prey they desire, but usually target deer, elk, and other large herbivores. Prowlers use their powerful bodies and gripping claws to drag their kill up into their tree nests, where it can be consumed at their leisure. These felines are known to travel long and winding paths through the forest, residing in temporary shelters throughout the seasons. Although nomadic, the prowlers are quite territorial of whatever area they currently inhabit. Relatively passive in the winter, they are most active in the spring and summer during peak hunting and breeding seasons.

The demon emits a cloud of poisonous gas that fills a 20-foot sphere and persists for 1 minute until it disperses into the surrounding air. The cloud spreads around corners, and the affected area is heavily obscured. Any creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw against the poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action on that turn retching and reeling. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) will disperse it after 1 round.</text>

    <description>For those still new to the art of summoning, a fumbled attempt to conjure forth an entity of great power often results in the appearance of a lesser demon in its place. These beings are lowly, vexing creatures, eager to sow discord wherever they have been called.

Vile and Malicious
While there are all manner of devils and demons that seek to terrorize the good folk of the world, others are more off-putting and disgusting—an embarrassing blunder for the fledgling witch or wizard whose invocation went awry. Although not particularly powerful, lesser demons can still pose a serious threat to inexperienced conjurors and unsuspecting civilians.

    <description>are more than the mere beasts travelers may mistake them for. Covered in rocky protrusions that serve to protect as well as camouflage them, mountain lions possess special powers as a result of their ties to the elemental earth of their territory.

Mountain Stalker
Mountain lions live and hunt in their craggy mountain homes. They are natural climbers and prefer to ambush unsuspecting prey rather than engage in prolonged chases across the treacherous cliffs. A pride of mountain lions is led and protected by a large female. Males compete for the right to mate, and work together as a hunting party. While not as adept at pack hunting as wolves, a few mountain lions working in tandem can take down dangerous creatures of unusual size, including basilisks and griffons.

Roar of the Earth
Owing to the magic of the elemental earth, mountain lions can gain limited control over nearby rocks with their roar. Using this ability, they can cause rockslides to hinder their prey's escape or inflict critical damage. The ability takes a great deal of energy, so many mountain lions use it sparingly, knowing it will be some time before they can call upon it again.

    <description>Deep in the murky marshes of the Mokk Fields, where water lays stagnant and the stench of decay permeates all, the worlds of life and death intertwine. Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as "slimes", these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach.

Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn't difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime's territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods.

In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called "slime-wranglers", whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for scholarly innovation.

Three main types of slimes have been classified, but as magical creatures with strange properties, it's speculated that more elusive slime species might exist somewhere in the remote swamps. The three documented types are: caustic slimes, shifting slimes, and sticky slimes.

Caustic Slime:
These pale green oozes have an astringent chemical odor, which mixes with the smell of liquefied flesh from their latest meal. Owing to the slow speed at which they digest their victims, the bones of partially-digested meals can be seen through their transparent exterior. Dissolving remnants move within the slimes in a macabre semblance of motion. This phenomena has earned them the nickname "green puppeteers".

Natural Defenses
Capable of producing a lethal acid that can eat away at stone and metal, caustic slimes are especially deadly. Even the slightest touch on exposed fur or feathers can be dangerous. Many would-be heroes have met a slow, grim demise after being engulfed by these strange creatures.

Scientific Interest
Though hazardous, the acid produced by these slimes is also valued for its potential uses as a powerful sorcery reagent and an ingredient in potent potions. Some claim it can be distilled into practical applications, like a solvent for metallurgists and builders.

If the shifting slime used its adaptive ability to become immune to a damage type, the damage dealt to the target on a failed save becomes that type instead. The shifting slime can have only one target swallowed at a time.

Three main types of slimes have been classified, but as magical creatures with strange properties, it's speculated that more elusive slime species might exist somewhere in the remote swamps. The three documented types are: caustic slimes, shifting slimes, and sticky slimes.

Shifting Slime:
A type of large and fluid ooze, shifting slimes have an iridescent hue to them which seems to shift as they move. According to slime-wranglers, they can use magical energy to create an eerie bioluminescence. Shifting slime residue is a highly sought after potent reagent, but it is hard to come by. Despite their size, these slimes are elusive and generally spend their time below ground where visibility is low. They can be quite difficult to locate when they conceal themselves in the subterranean darkness, though these strange creatures are known to leave trails of bioluminescent residue to lure in prey.

Adaptive Defenses
This type of slime can harness magical energy within its form. Shifting slimes absorb and store magic passively over time, but are also capable of absorbing magical jolts from spells. It is unclear exactly how much energy they can store, or for how long.

Shifting slimes can develop a temporary immunity to various types of magic after exposure. This immunity in turn makes it exceptionally difficult to destroy the slimes with a single type of magical energy. Luckily for slime-wranglers, shifting slimes are only capable of containing one energy type at a time.

Manifestation of Stored Power
After absorbing magical energy, these slimes will change color based on the type of power absorbed. Because of the rarity of shifting slimes, only a handful of people have witnessed these changes. But, over generations, skilled slime-wranglers have managed to record which color a shifting slime will turn in response to different types of magic.

    <description>Wakewyrms are massive reptiles that have aspects of both snakes and eels. On rare occasions they've been spotted close to the shores of the Talongrip Coast, though many are quick to dismiss these accounts. Their name originates from the powerful tidal waves their bodies cause, which pose a considerable threat to nearby vessels.

Ocean Tales
Despite their size, wakewyrms are elusive, able to hide within the vast expanse of the ocean. The rarity of this creature has bred many rumors about the exact nature of wakewyrms. All sailors know at least a few stories about bizarre creatures of the sea, including fantastical accounts of wakewyrms that lurk in the ocean's gloomy depths, able to sink an entire fleet of ships. Such tales are more often fabrications than not, as few have actually encountered these creatures.

Devourer from the Deeps
Wakewyrms are more than a 100 feet long and weigh over 1000 tons. Their lashing tails, snapping jaws, and huge bodies can deal significant damage to a ship's hull, though they prefer to swallow sailors whole, swiftly pulling them into the fathoms below with hardly more than a splash. Filling their gullet with as many creatures as possible, wakewyrms let their strong stomachs take care of their meals. While a fine tactic for devouring fish or other large marine creatures, wakewyrms that swallow adventurers whole sometimes find the snack too much to handle.

Though wakewyrms rarely encounter sailing vessels as they cross the ocean looking for food, the results are often violent. Afterwards, all that remains is nothing but a derelict phantom ship, found wrecked against the rocks of distant shores.

    <description>It may be odd to see birdfolk working the docks and ships of Saltar's Port, but the sea is a way of life for some folk. Jobs in the seafaring industry are as lucrative as they are tough. For the birdfolk that choose to ply their trade on the water, life is about order and efficiency. One improperly stowed barrel or poorly lashed line can spell disaster on the sea. Dockmasters take their marine jobs very seriously.

    <description>Simple farmers can be found across the Wood, providing necessary food and supplies to the cities. There are many places in Humblewood where digging up large heaps of soil would either be impractical or damaging to the forest. While traditional farms exists in Humblewood, the majority of farms are built in the canopies in or around cities. Farming in the canopy consists of growing flowering moss gardens or fruit-bearing vines on the branches of perch trees. Canopy farms can also include the raising of large insects for food, or silkworms for clothing.

    <description>Aspiring recruits from all over the Wood flock to the Perch Guard headquarters in the capital of Alderheart to join their ranks. After successful training, these newly sworn guards return to their home perch. They serve with pride, acting as the perch's first line of defense. Under the Humblefolk Treaty, members of the Perch Guard are tasked to aid nearby villages on the forest floor whenever necessary. In larger cities like Alderheart, the Perch Guard are also responsible for dealing with inner city issues such as robbery, bar fights, and investigating and arresting criminals.
