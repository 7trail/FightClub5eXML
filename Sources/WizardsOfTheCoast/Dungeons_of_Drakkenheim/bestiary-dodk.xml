Each creature in the animated sludge's space must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes grappled by the sludge if it is Large or smaller (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the sludge's space.

The sludge can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the sludge's turns, each target grappled by it takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination.

A creature within 5 feet of the sludge can attempt to pull a creature or object out of it. This takes an action and requires a successful DC 14 Strength check.</text>

    <description>Contaminated Elementals can be found all over Drakkenheim, often in areas where the eldritch magics are especially concentrated. Many who have encountered these elementals have spoken of the city itself coming to life to attack them. Reports of ruins reaching out and crushing adventurers, burning flames moving and hunting with minds of their own, or contaminated pools lurching to engulf passersby have been heard. Even the blowing air itself has mustered parts of the Haze into shifting clouds that stalk adventurers through the streets. These magical creatures are a constant reminder that nothing in the city can be trusted, and that nowhere is truly safe.

Each creature of the Crimson Countess' choice that is within 120 feet of her and not deafened must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the effects of the Crimson Countess' Frightful Screech for the next 24 hours.

While frightened by this effect, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the Crimson Countess by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the Crimson Countess, the creature can repeat the saving throw.

— Elias Drexel

Many who succumb to contamination become grotesque mockeries of their former selves. They suffer a wretched and loathsome fate, aimlessly wandering the ruins following half-forgotten memories. Most are gripped by despair, fear, and madness which drive them to act violently, though a rare few experience lucidity and a gruesome awareness of their miserable state. Their distorted and emaciated bodies are sustained by the magic of the Haze.

Many who succumb to contamination become grotesque mockeries of their former selves. They suffer a wretched and loathsome fate, aimlessly wandering the ruins following half-forgotten memories. Most are gripped by despair, fear, and madness which drive them to act violently, though a rare few experience lucidity and a gruesome awareness of their miserable state. Their distorted and emaciated bodies are sustained by the magic of the Haze.

    <description>Contaminated Elementals can be found all over Drakkenheim, often in areas where the eldritch magics are especially concentrated. Many who have encountered these elementals have spoken of the city itself coming to life to attack them. Reports of ruins reaching out and crushing adventurers, burning flames moving and hunting with minds of their own, or contaminated pools lurching to engulf passersby have been heard. Even the blowing air itself has mustered parts of the Haze into shifting clouds that stalk adventurers through the streets. These magical creatures are a constant reminder that nothing in the city can be trusted, and that nowhere is truly safe.

Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (6d6 + 9) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Immediately after making a ranged attack, this weapon flies back to the Executioner's hands.</text>

    <description>Once thought to be related to gnolls, garmyr are bipedal canids unique to the Haze-ridden ruins of Drakkenheim. Often covered in thick fur, their colouration and features vary from hound-like to wolf-like, but all bear sharp teeth and claws. They form hyper-aggressive and predatory warpacks equipped with weapons taken from the many failed military attempts to reclaim the city. These beasts revel in their countless battles with adventurers and the Hooded Lanterns. The garmyr warpacks have made the Inner City their hunting ground, but have been sighted roving the countryside with increasing frequency. They live for the thrill of the hunt, and mock and taunt their prey as they chase them down. Though the warpacks are prone to infighting, a massive beast known as the Lord of the Feast rules the garmyr as their overlord, master, and god.

Magical octarine beams flash from the Gravekeeper's many lanterns. Each beam has a different power. Each creature within 120 feet of the Gravekeeper which is not behind total cover rolls a d6 to determine which colour ray affects it. The DC for all saving throws is 18:

1. Dispelling Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 35 (10d6) psychic damage, and any spell or magical effect upon the target ends. A creature who fails this saving throw has their concentration broken on any spell they were actively maintaining.

2. Forceful Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 35 (10d6) force damage, be pushed 20 feet away, and knocked prone.

3. Blinding Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) radiant damage and be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

4. Contamining Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination.

5. Igniting Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (10d6) fire damage, and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 35 (10d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

6. Freezing Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) cold damage, and it can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the blast's other effects.</text>

    <description>"The Royal Crypts below Castle Drakken housed the bodies of kings and queens, dukes and nobles of generations gone. They were tended by the many gravekeepers who worked diligently to light the lanterns below so the dead could have safe passage to the light. I shudder to think what has become of those crypts, and their keepers, in these dark times."
— Overheard from a party of nobles in the Red Lion Hotel

The Gravekeeper is a hovering mass of writhing appendages. Amongst its horrid and grotesque form one can make out the many faces of long lost gravekeepers of Castle Drakken, but their expressions are twisted in horror of their last moments, and their eyes are hollow with a dim octarine light emanating from within. Covering the floating mass are hundreds of arms, several of them holding softly glowing lanterns. The lanterns glow with octarine flames that cast flickering shadows across the crypt. The Gravekeeper wanders amongst the dead, awakening them into grasping souls, clawing their way out of the many graves amongst the lordly tombs of the castle.

Lair Actions:
When fighting inside its lair, the Gravekeeper can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Gravekeeper can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

	• A 10 foot radius cylinder of delerium sludge spouts up from the floor and raises 30 feet into the air before bubbling back down. Any creature caught in this spout must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. They take 42 (12d6) necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much on a successful one. In addition, characters who fail the saving throw gain one level of contamination.

	• Walls within 120 feet of the Gravekeeper sprout grasping, fleshy arms. Each creature of the Gravekeepers choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

	• A torch or lantern hanging in the room emits one of the Gravekeeper's lantern blasts.

The Gravekeeper can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

If the juggernaut moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the juggernaut can make another slam attack against it as a bonus action.</text>

    <description>Delerium dregs continue to be wracked with new mutations. Eventually, many simply collapse into a mewling mass of flesh and organs and become gibbering mouthers. Others grow into much larger and twisted forms.

If damage reduces the haze husk to 0 hit points, the delerium fragments in its body explode in a burst of contaminated energy, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. Creatures who fail this saving throw by 5 or more gain one level of contamination.</text>

    <description>Those who die in the ruins find no respite. The Haze reanimates their remains to wander the streets as shells forever stuck in the terror of their final moments. Billowing eldritch energies emanate from their eyes, mouth, and wounds and delerium fragments are fused into their flesh.
