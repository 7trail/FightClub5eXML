        <name>Divine Domain: Mushroom Domain</name>
        <text>The massive, strange mushroom jungles pulse with an inherent energy that is considered to be a kind of anima mundi suffusing all, its power springing from the massive, gorgeous jumble of colors, spores and life pulsing eternally in the underworld. The propagation of these places and the protection of their biomes have become nigh rapturous experiences for some of the devout, with enlightenment beckoning in the hallucinogenic spores, teas and armors crafted from the very mushrooms themselves.

        <name>Mushroom Domain: Mushroom-Whisperer</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you learn the language of mushrooms, allowing you to enter a strange form of communication with mushrooms. By touching a mushroom, you can imbue it with limited sentience, allowing it to communicate with you. You can question fungi about events within 30 feet of their location that have transpired within the day, gleaning information about creatures that have passed, weather and similar circumstances. You also become proficient in your choice two of the following skills: Insight, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using either of those skills chosen.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Mushroom Domain: Hallucinogenic Visions</name>
        <text>Beginning at 6th level, your explosive caps contain inert, but hallucinogenic spores over which you can exert a modicum of control. When you throw an explosive cap, it detonates and leaves behind a wispy cloud of spores that lasts until the end of your next turn.

The cloud is a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the target and it does not impede sight. As an action on your turn, you can will the spores to coalesce on a target currently within the cloud of spores that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, it experiences strange hallucinations and must roll on Hallucinations table. The effects of hallucinogenic visions last for 1 minute.

Hallucinations:
d6 | You see...
1 | You're sinking into quicksand!
2 | You're being swarmed by tiny spiders!
3 | An item you're holding turns into a viper!
4 | The air is suffering as you breath it!
5 | You've shrunk to the size of an acorn!
6 | Gravity has reversed! Hold on!
