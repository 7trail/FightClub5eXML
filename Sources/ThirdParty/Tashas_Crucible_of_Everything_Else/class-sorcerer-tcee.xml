        <text>Some creatures are born with an innate connection to the Weave and can use their own bodies as a spellcasting focus. These sorcerers often find their abilities well suited to life in the wild frontier or as clandestine agents for powerful organizations.

Any number of factors can bestow this gift upon a creature. Known spellslingers often cite events such as the following for their gifts: surviving a magical cataclysm, a blessing of a powerful fey monarch, an ancestor's bargain with an otherworldly being, or sheer dumb luck.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic Remastered</name>
        <text>One of the most common complaints about the Wild Magic sorcerer is that it has an excellent narrative, but much weaker mechanics than its counterparts, and that its relies heavily on having a highly skilled Dungeon Master. That's a lot of pressure for a DM! This remastered version aims to ameliorate these problems in the following ways:

	• Rephrase the Wild Magic Surge feature as a Wild Magic Trigger feature to reduce confusion about when you should roll 1d20 or 1d100.
	• Restructure the Wild Magic Surge and Tides of Chaos features so they don't have to rely so heavily on the Dungeon Master. Now you always have a 5% chance of a spell going wildly out of control, not a 5% chance only at the DM's discretion. After you've used your Tides of Chaos feature, this chance increases to 10%, but the DM can still indicate your magic goes wildly out of control anyways.
	• Increase the power of the Bend Luck feature to be more comparable to the Divine Soul sorcerer's Favoured By The Gods feature and bards' Bardic Inspiration feature.
	• Other minor balance adjustments to further pursue the 'risk vs. reward' narrative and design philosophy.

        <name>Wild Magic Remastered: Wild Magic Trigger</name>
        <text>Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Each time you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20 immediately after. This is called a Wild Magic Trigger roll. If you roll a 1 on the die, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (1d100) to create a magical effect. If the effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

You can find the Wild Magic Surge table in the original Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin in the Player's Handbook.

You can do so after the creature rolls but before you know whether the roll succeeds or fails.
