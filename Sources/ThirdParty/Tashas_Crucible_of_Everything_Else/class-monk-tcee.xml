        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Mundanity</name>
        <text>There are those who study the arcane as a means to change the world around them. There is a certain arrogance in that concept, so in order to maintain balance there exists a group dedicated to preservation of the natural and the mundane. Monks who follow the Way of Mundanity use both the study of magic and the mastery of their own internal energies to battle those who use the arcane.

        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Iron Grasp</name>
        <text>Balance is lost when one disrupts the livelihood of another. Monks of the Way of the Iron Grasp are taught to establish safety and order within their sphere of influence, training relentlessly in martial techniques to pin down foes and protect allies. Many of this tradition wear gauntlets that they forge themselves as a symbol of their dedication and ideals.

Monasteries that teach this tradition often act as militias for nearby settlements or as a council that oversees and rules adjacent villages and towns. The heads of these monasteries offer respect towards even the lowest of peasants, but have no tolerance for troublemakers. Still, they risk life and limb to hold the peace when external threats arise, regardless of who needs protection.

        <name>Way of the Iron Grasp: Iron Grasp Technique</name>
        <text>You can disrupt the flow of ki in another creature's body with grappling techniques that prevent it from moving and harming allies.

You master special martial arts techniques used to disable opponents and safeguard allies. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows and that creature is no more than one size category larger than you, you can force the creature to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) against your ki save DC. On a failed save, the target is grappled by you. You must use a free hand for the grapple as normal.

While grappled in this way, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you. If the creature uses its action to try to escape the grapple, it makes its ability check against your ki save DC. When it does so, you can expend 1 ki point as a reaction to impose disadvantage on its ability check.

You must be either within 5 feet of the target or the attacker, or be providing the target with half cover against the attack.

    <!-- Way of the Four Elements Remastered -->

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Four Elements Remastered</name>
        <text>This Remastered subclass aims to bring the Four Elements subclass up to the precedent set by the other Player's Handbook monk subclasses in the following ways:

	• It recalculates the ki cost of spells and other abilities.
	• It restructures the Disciple of the Elements feature. Now, as an elemental master, you know all Elemental Disciplines, but can only prepare 2-5 each day, depending on your level in this class.
	• It gives you access to elemental cantrips. You learn one elemental control cantrip and one damaging elemental cantrip. Full casters, masters of magic, learn additional cantrips at 6th and 11th levels. As an elemental master, you also learn additional cantrips at those levels.
	• It provides new Elemental Discipline options. Some of these provide access to suitable spells from the Player's Handbook, Elemental Evil Player's Companion, or Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Others offer passive ability options or other creative options from our design team. including passive ability options that have unlimited uses.

        <name>Way of the Four Elements Remastered: Disciple of the Elements</name>
        <text>You can speak, read, and write Primordial, and you know magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. Most disciplines require you to spend ki points each time you use it.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can prepare two Elemental Disciplines of your choice, all of which are detailed in the "Elemental Disciplines" section below. If an Elemental Discipline has prerequisites, you must meet them to prepare it. A level prerequisite refers to your monk level. You can prepare one additional Elemental Discipline at a time at 6th, 11th, and 17th levels.

        <name>Way of the Four Elements Remastered: Casting Elemental Spells</name>
        <text>Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.

Spells and Ki Points:
Monk Levels | Maximum Ki Points for a Spell
5th-8th | 3
9th-16th | 4
17th-20th | 5
