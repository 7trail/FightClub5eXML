You can spend 1 ki point to cast Detect Magic.

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

    <text>Prerequisite: 6th level

You've learned to use your ki to disrupt the magical nature of other creatures or objects.

You can spend 3 ki points to cast counterspell, dispel magic, nondetection, or remove curse, using Wisdom as your spellcasting modifier. Beginning at 17th level, you can also spend 8 ki points to cast antimagic field as an action.

Counterspell:
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

Dispel Magic:
Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ab

Nondetection:
For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

Remove Curse:
At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

Antimagic Field:
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Item: a suit of armor (requires attunement)

When you finish a short or long rest, you can cast a cantrip or a spell of 1st level with a casting time of 1 action, and describe a circumstance. For example, you could set up the armor to cast cure wounds on the person wearing this armor when they are reduced to zero hit points. The spell takes effect when the circumstance you described is met, rather than when you cast it. The spell can only affect the person wearing and attuned to this item, even if it can normally target others. Once the spell is cast, the armor loses this ability until the next dawn.

Item: a crystal worth at least 100 gp

You have learned how to harness the power of magic to momentarily restore a creature to life. As an action, you can thrust the item you infused into a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life for one minute with 1 hit point and a number of temporary hit points equal to five times your artificer level. After the minute is over, if the creature is still alive, it dies.

Once used, the corpse shaker must recharge and cannot be used again for 24 hours.
