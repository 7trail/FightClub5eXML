Unable to fly like the majority of their avian comrades, penguin aara- kocra are instead fantastic swimmers. Even the fastest avian aarakocra admit that the penguin breed poses a suitable challenge when they take to the water.

      <text>Fierce mountaineers, the Ibexi race are anthropomorphic goats. They have cloven hooves instead of hands and feet, but with an opposable secondary hoof, their hands are just as dextrous as those of other humanoids. While they share clear physical traits with satyrs and bariaur, the typical Ibexi culture is worlds apart.

    </trait>
    <trait category="Description">
      <name>Rugged Recreation</name>
      <text>Most Ibexi do not care for the pomp and circumstance of fine art and poetry, although they have their own artforms. Rich oral histories recount tales of ancient gods creating them from the stones of the mountains, and elegant dance ceremonies offer fealty to these nature spirits. In their free time, many Ibexis enjoy friendly wrestling matches and footraces, and hold jubilant dances to traditional folk music at least once a month.

Ibexi Sports:
Ibexi love to be active, and their enjoy- ment is multiplied exponentially when others join them in their romping pastimes. Favorite activities include the standard stick-pull (though many prefer a varia- tion where you join hooves instead of hold a stick), leg wrestling (the loser is often just as pleased to be thrown as the winner is to win), footbag (which can sometimes go for hours, often with rules conjured on the fly), and "tree-tussles" (where one or two contestants form a "tree" by standing on the shoulders of another, and they try to dismantle the other "trees'' without breaking their own form).

Usually good natured in their escapades, Ibexi characters will often challenge allies to friendly athletic competitions, and may become sad and unhealthy if they do not experience regular physical activity and bond with others through sport.

You can find secure footholds almost no other creature could. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you do not have to use your hooves on the end of your arms to hold on to non-sheer surfaces. For example, if you are climbing a cliff and are attacked by flying creatures, you can use your hooves on the end of your arms to swing a two-handed weapon, cast a spell, or use a single-handed weapon and a shield, all without falling.

      <text>The kuo-toa are a race of fishlike humanoids who were enslaved by the illithids millennia ago. They were driven mad by their captivity, and even to this day they harbor some of the realms' most insane philosophers.

    <trait category="Description">
      <name>Religious Deviants</name>
      <text>Most races claim to be the creation of some sort of progenitor god. Not the kuo-toa. Much to the awe and horror of every scholar who learns of them, the kuo-toa can create their own gods. If enough of their shattered minds believe an invented god is real, they can grant it life and a physical body.

      <text>It is rare that a kuo-toa leaves the safety of its people to strike out as an adventurer. The kuo-toa tend to hate other races, and the feeling is mutual. However, if a kuo-toa can get past its xenophobia, learn to abide sunlight, and agree to observe local laws concerning cannibalism, they can be a strange and unique addition to any party.

You can use the Kuo-Toa Quirks table to determine what strange behaviors your character might have.

Kuo-Toa Quirks:
d6 | Quirks
1 | You feel no reason to follow those who aren't physi- cally higher than you are.
2 | You are quick to point out the flaws of everyone around you.
3 | You only talk when waving your hands doesn't do the job.
4 | You assume every rumor of wrongdoing must be true.
5 | You always walk about in your sleep, mumbling about the new god you just discovered.
6 | You have a tendency to wander, leaving the room without warning and returning only when you feel like it.
