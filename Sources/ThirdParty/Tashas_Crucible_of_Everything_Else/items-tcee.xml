    <text>This 5-foot roll of sticky tape is imbued with a variation of the alarm spell. It functions as normal tape, unless you speak the command word when removing a portion. If a creature besides you cuts this portion of tape or removes it from its place, a blaring alarm produces the sound of an emergency claxon for 10 seconds, clearly audible within 600 feet.

Only one portion of tape can be enchanted in this way at a time. If you attempt to activate another portion of tape with another piece already activated, the older portion deactivates.

If you lose attunement with this tape, any activated portions immediately deactivate. Reattuning to the tape does not reactivate such a portion.

    <text>This amulet is made of a blue crystal, and seems to have a large grey moth entombed within. As a bonus action while wearing this amulet in moonlight or in the Feywild, you can manifest ethereal moth wings from your back, gaining a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings persist for 1 hour, but become useless while you are in bright light. Once you manifest the wings, you can't do so again until the next dusk.</text>

    <text>These bracers have 5 charges. While you are attuned to these bracers, you can expend 1 charge after you cast a spell to reroll any roll of 1 on the spell's damage dice but you may not use this effect more than once per turn. You can also use your reaction when you are hit by a spell attack roll to expend 1 charge, giving you a +1 bonus to AC against it and possibly preventing the effects of that spell. The bracers regain 1d4+1 charges daily at dawn.

    <text>This dagger seems to bend, reaching toward those you have killed. This acts as a +1 dagger that deals necrotic damage rather than piercing damage. Once each day, when you kill a Small or Medium humanoid with this dagger, you can use your reaction to turn them into a zombie as if by the animate dead spell.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, dagger
