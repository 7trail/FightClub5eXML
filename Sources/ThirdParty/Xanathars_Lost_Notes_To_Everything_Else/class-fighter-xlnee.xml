        <name>Martial Archetype: Dragoon</name>
        <text>A mounted soldier's primary objective is to carve a swath through the enemy lines, breaking the ranks of footmen for his or her infantry to exploit. Dragoons are elite combatants, selected from the ranks of standard cavalry soldiers for their prowess in battle and exceptional mounted dexterity. Their specialized training focuses as much on scouting and survival as it does advanced unit tactics, creating warriors who are just as effective on their own as with the main body of an army.

A dragoon's effectiveness comes from seamlessly weaving a variety of weapons into mounted tactics in order to control the ebb and flow of the battlefield and halt any retreat.

While the refined techniques of the dragoon are typically employed by the regimented armies of humans, elves, and dwarves, there are tribes of barbarians and even wolf-mounted goblins that have cultivated a form of this style with their favored blade or axe.

        <name>Dragoon: Cavalry Weapons: Haft or Hilt</name>
        <text>Issued upon the entrance to training, sabers are the typical dragoon's weapon of choice. These weapons share the length and weight of a longsword, with the curvature of a scimitar, and are designed to be light enough for use in one hand, but not for two-weapon combat. A cavalry weapon can be any one-handed weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage and doesn't have the light or finesse properties. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your cavalry weapon deals 1d8 damage, regardless of its damage die.

In trained hands, the saber is a graceful and deadly weapon but even a seasoned fighter might find them clumsy when dealing with its balance. Certain cultures dragoons might favor raiding axes or falchions but it is common practice for units to be familiar with the weapons and tactics of their counterparts.

        <name>Dragoon: Elevated Control</name>
        <text>While cavalry traditionally refers to a mounted soldier on horseback, many armies cultivate whatever animal is best suited to the purpose in that region. While unusual, it isn't unheard of for camels, elephants, or even giant reptiles to serve such a purpose in wartime. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence any beast with the capacity to be used as a mount.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Dragoon: Versatile Combat</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, through rigorous training your mastery of cavalry weapons makes you effective in heavy armor, but even more so in medium or light armor, allowing a rakish freedom to press a tactical advantage in any situation. In exchange for heavy armor's protection, mounted or not, you gain maneuverability and precision. When wearing medium armor, you add double your Strength modifier to damage rolls with your cavalry weapon and your speed increases by 5 feet. While you're mounted, the speed of your mount also increases by 5 feet.

When unarmored, or wearing light armor, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any attack rolls you make with your cavalry weapon, in addition to the benefits of wearing medium armor, and your speed increases by an additional 5 feet, to a total of 10 feet. While you're mounted, the speed of your mount also increases in this way.

Additionally, when you use the Attack action to attack with a cavalry weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded one-handed ranged weapon you are holding. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on this ranged attack.

        <name>Dragoon: Line Breaker</name>
        <text>At 7th level, you have learned to identify the break points in the enemy's line and can clear the way for your allies to follow. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks and use your Move action to move least 20 feet in a straight line. When you do so, each creature in your path must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice and falls prone.

Creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw if you are mounted.

        <text>At 10th level, your battlefield awareness allows you to sense a retreat and cut it off as it happens. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

Starting at 18th level, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make an opportunity attack against you for the rest of your turn.

        <text>Starting at 15th level, moving through difficult terrain costs you, or your mount, no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

While traveling for an hour or more while mounted, you gain the following benefits:

	• Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. 
	• Your group can't become lost except by magical means. 
	• Even when you're engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. 
	• If you are traveling alone, or with up to nine other mounted creatures, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. 
	• While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact numbers, their sizes and how long ago they passed through the area.

        <name>Runeguard: Master Runes</name>
        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn five master runes; Ild (fire), Kalt (frost), Ond (spirit), Stein (Stone), and Vind (wind). While these names are known to you as the basis for empowering your equipment, their application continues to require diligent study, constant trial, and repeated error to evoke the unique properties from each variant invocation.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Runeguard: Runecraft</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you learn augmentations that utilize the master runes to enhance your martial prowess. Their effects are based on how you invoke them, generating defensive properties to thwart your foes' advance or deal decisive blows.

Ritual Crafting:
Each runic combination must be inscribed and empowered into your equipment over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest. Each piece of equipment must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which, you infuse a part of your being into the runes, causing them to glow slightly with your own spiritual essence.

The rune's power fades if it moves more than 100 feet away from you and can't be used by anyone other than you.

Runic Augmentations:
You learn three runic augmentations of your choice from the 'Runic Augmentations' spell list. Each augmentation is specific to its master rune; for instance, if you learn the Sokn augmentation of the Ild master rune, you don't gain the ability to use the Sokn augmentation with other master runes unless you also learn that specific combination.

Once you activate one of your runic augmentations, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

You learn two additional augmentations at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn new augmentations, you can choose to replace one you already know with a different one.

Augmentation Activation:
During your turn, you can activate a single runic augmentation by focusing on the rune's power. You can activate one of these augmentations on your turn using your bonus action to empower your attacks (Sokn), your reaction to entrench your defenses (Vard) or skillfully enhance another ability (Hagr) with your action.

Activating a rune requires concentration, which lasts a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 3). While you concentrate on a rune, you can cast spells but you can't concentrate on a rune and a spell at the same time. You gain the ability to concentrate on two runes at once at 10th level.

Saving Throws:
Some of your runic augmentations require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Runic save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

The DM tells you the general location of magic writing used in rite or ritual within 60 feet of you, whether active or dormant, and you know the type (arcane, divine, or otherwise) of any script you sense but not its exact purpose or power. You can use this feature a number of times a day equal to your proficiency bonus.

        <text>Beginning at 10th level, you can unleash the energy of your runes to devastating effect by shouting the command word Tal as an action (see "Tal" under Runic Augmentations). Choose one Tal effect from the runes you have active, and all active augmentations go dormant until you finish a short or long rest. You can still use other augmentations you have yet to activate. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Starting at 15th level, you can use this feature twice before a rest, but only once per turn.

You can activate a rune with the Sokn augmentation as a bonus action. A rune's power only affects the weapon it is inscribed on.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you ignite the target. While this rune is active, each creature you've burned takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of its turn for each time you've burned it, and it can then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such burns on itself on a success. Alternatively, the burned creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your runic save DC, ending the effect of all burns on it on a success.
