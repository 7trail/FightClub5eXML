        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Ancestral Weapon (MCA UA)</name>
        <text>Your innate magic remained dormant until the first time you picked up the legendary weapon of your bloodline. Ancestral weapons derive their power from many sources. Some weapons are blessed by a god or powerful being. Others are forged with magic within them and bound to the family's blood. Some are even said to hold fragments of the previous wielders' souls within them. Ancestral weapons are sometimes sentient, or able to communicate with the wielder, but this is not always so. When an ancestral weapon is held by one with the blood of lineage, they are granted both martial prowess and the magical ability of their ancestors.

        <name>Ancestral Weapon (MCA UA): Bonus Proficiencies</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with light armor, shields, and one type of martial melee weapon of your choice.

        <name>Ancestral Weapon (MCA UA): Ancient's Aegis</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action, you can grant an aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you.

The aegis takes the form of a spectral shield-bearer that protects the target. The aegis can absorb a number of points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage equal to 4 + half your sorcerer level. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until the aegis is depleted, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Ancestral Weapon (MCA UA): Ancestral Weapon</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you gain an ancestral weapon that endows you with magical power.

Your ancestral weapon is any martial melee weapon of your choice. You can use your ancestral weapon as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

Additionally, if you are separated from your ancestral weapon, you can use your bonus action to magically bring it to your hand, regardless of its distance or location.

You can transform a magic melee weapon into your ancestral weapon by performing a special ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. After the ritual, the weapon assumes the form of your ancestral weapon. The magic weapon ceases being your ancestral weapon and reverts to its prior form if you die, or if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon.

        <name>Ancestral Weapon (MCA UA): Weapon Channeling</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you learn to cast spells through the strike of your ancestral weapon.

Whenever you take the Attack action during your turn, as a bonus action you can cast a sorcerer cantrip or spend 1 sorcery point to cast a sorcerer spell. The spell or cantrip must require a spell attack roll as part of its effect.

If you do so, its casting time becomes one bonus action, its range becomes equal to your reach and you must target the same creature you targeted with the melee attack. Ranged spell attacks made in this manner do not have disadvantage if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature. You follow other rules normally for casting it, including expending a spell slot.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Ancestral Weapon (MCA UA): Ancient's Assistance</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits a target protected by your Ancient's Aegis with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. You can then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 2d10 force damage. This extra damage increases to 3d10 at 17th level. You can teleport in this manner a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Phoenix Soul (MCA UA)</name>
        <text>Your power draws from the immortal flame of the legendary phoenix. That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Phoenix Soul (MCA UA): Ignite</name>
        <text>At 1st level, as an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand that isn't being worn or carried.

Starting at 14th level, you can ignite creatures in this manner. When you touch a creature, it takes 1d6 fire damage and it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, or until the effect ends, the ignited creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the effect ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the effect ends.

        <name>Phoenix Soul (MCA UA): Mantle of Flame</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action, you magically wreathe yourself in swirling fire. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

	• You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

	• Any creature takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier if it hits you with a melee attack from within 5 feet of you or if it touches you.

	• Whenever you roll fire damage on your turn, the roll gains a bonus to equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <name>Phoenix Soul (MCA UA): Phoenix Spark</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to instead be reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier.

If you use this feature while under the effects of your Mantle of Flame, this feature instead deals fire damage equal to your sorcerer level + twice your Charisma modifier, and your Mantle of Flame immediately ends.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
