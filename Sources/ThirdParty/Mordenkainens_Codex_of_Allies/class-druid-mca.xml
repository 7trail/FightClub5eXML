        <text>When a druid's forest burns down, there are an occasional few who find a newfound power awakened by the inferno. These druids find within themselves an inner fire that fills them with burning passion and allows them to become frightening wielders of magical fire. Like the wildfire, they burn away the old and dead so that new life can spring up from the ashes.

        <name>Conflagration (MCA UA): Circle of Conflagration Spells</name>
        <text>Your connection to the destructive power of nature grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the control flames cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Conflagration Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Circle of Conflagration Spells:
Level | Spells
3rd | flaming sphere, pyrotechnics
5th | fireball, gaseous form
7th | freedom of movement, wall of fire

        <name>Conflagration (MCA UA): Fire from Within</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action and expend a spell slot to allow the fire burning within you to emerge as a glowing flame that surrounds your body for 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated.

The flame casts bright light for 15 feet and dim light for an additional 15 feet. You can choose the color of the flame and the color of the light that it casts.

While this flame burns, whenever a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see casts a spell or makes an attack against you or an ally, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 fire damage per level of the spell slot expended and be ignited. An ignited creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until they or another creature douses the fire as an action, or they move more than 15 feet away from you.

You can see through an area heavily obscured by smoke or fire as though it were only lightly obscured, provided that the smoke or fire is natural or originates from a spell you are casting.

        <text>Starting at 14th level, whenever a fire you have lit is extinguished, new plant life begins to grow.

If the extinguished fire was on the ground or an object, grasses and flowers begin sprouting after 8 hours. If an ignited creature is extinguished, plants immediately begin to grow around them, reducing their movement speed by 15 feet until they or another creature removes the plants as an action.

In addition, as a bonus action you can extinguish a 15-foot-wide cube of fire that you can see within 60 feet of you.

        <name>Primeval Guardian (MCA UA): Guardian Form</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you use your Wild Shape feature, instead of transforming, you can attune to a guardian spirit for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down).

While you are attuned in this manner, as a bonus action, you can assume a tree-like guardian form, which lasts until you end it as a bonus action, until you are incapacitated, or until you use your Wild Shape again. You undergo the following changes while in your guardian form:

	• Your size becomes Large, unless you were larger.
	• Any speed you have becomes 5 feet, unless the speed was lower.
	• Your reach increases by 5 feet unless your reach was already increased in another way.
	• You are constantly under the effects of the barkskin spell.
	• Once during each of your turns, you can deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage to one creature you hit with a melee weapon attack or a melee spell attack. This damage increases to 2d8 at 10th level.

        <text>At 6th level, you gain the following benefits.

You gain a number of temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns while in your guardian form. The number equals half your druid level. When the form ends, you lose any temporary hit points you have from it.

Your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2 per druid level when you assume your guardian form. This increase lasts until you leave the form; your hit point maximum then returns to normal, but your current hit points remain the same, unless they must decrease to abide by your hit point maximum.
