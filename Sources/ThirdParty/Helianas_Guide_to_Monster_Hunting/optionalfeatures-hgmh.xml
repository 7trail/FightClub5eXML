You trap a 5-foot square with a mechanical, toothy-jawed trap. When a Large or smaller creature enters the trapped area, the trap activates and the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage, and its speed becomes 0 feet unless it's immune to being grappled. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your ranger save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success.

The bear trap's non-lethal cousin, the snare trap, tangles a creature's feet, causing it to fall. You trap a 5-foot square with ropes and vines. When a Large or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, the trap activates and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, and its speed becomes 0 feet unless it's immune to being grappled. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your ranger save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success.

When activated, a 20-foot-radius sphere of flame erupts, centred on the trap. Each creature in the area when the trap detonates must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

When activated, a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap fills with gas for the next minute or until strong wind disperses it. The gas spreads around corners, lightly obscures the area, and penetrates through creatures' skin, affecting them even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe. When a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws it makes to maintain its concentration.

When activated, there is a flare of brilliant octarine light, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become soulbound, as per the preserve spell. In addition, while a creature is soulbound in this way, it can't benefit from being invisible. Creatures possessing robust or more powerful essence within their bodies (typically, those of CR 7 or higher) automatically succeed on this saving throw.

You can expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher when you create this trap instead of a 2nd-level slot. When you do so, creatures with robust or less powerful essence (typically CR 11 or lower) must make the saving throw, while creatures with potent or more powerful essence automatically succeed.

Because of their nature, pit traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can't be moved. After the trap activates, you can spend 1 minute recovering it, allowing it to be used again.

You dig a 7-foot-deep hole in dirt, or another diggable surface, in a 5-foot square. You can choose to fill the pit with sharpened stakes, spikes, or any other sharp materials.

When a Medium or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls into the pit, where it lands prone, taking 4d8 piercing damage if the trap is filled with spikes. On a success, it avoids the trap, falling prone in the nearest unoccupied space to the trap. A creature that succeeds on the save by 5 or more doesn't fall prone.

When activated, horrifying illusions abound and psychic energy twists the minds of creatures. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 psychic damage and becomes affected, as per the confusion spell for the next minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

With a large, concealed net of rope or vines, and an apparatus hidden in branches or a cave's ceiling, you create a 20-foot square trapped area. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained and hoisted 20 feet up into the air (or as high as the canopy/ceiling allows).

A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your ranger save DC, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) ends the effect and destroys the net.

If there is a Huge or larger creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.

When activated, a 30-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap erupts with deafening thunder. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 thunder damage and be deafened for the next minute. The noise can be heard 2,000 feet away, or even further in echoey locations or underwater.

Because of their nature, catapult traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can't be moved.

With bent trees, springs, or elastic rope, you create a 20-foot square of tension. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer in the area. If it's still in the area, it is affected as if it failed its save. A creature that fails the saving throw is flung 60 feet in a direction you decide when you deploy the trap, landing prone and taking 6d10 bludgeoning damage.

If there is a Gargantuan creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.

When you create this trap, choose one of the diseases from the contagion spell. When activated, pustulant boils grow and erupt on surfaces in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is affected as if hit by the attack in the contagion spell (using the disease you chose).

When activated, the area within a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap suddenly drops to a debilitatingly low temperature for the next minute. When a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6d6 cold damage and, until the start of its next turn, its speed is halved and it can't take reactions. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't otherwise affected.

When activated, a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on the trap flares into life, attempting to suck all creatures in it into a harmless demiplane. Each creature in the area when the trap activates must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to the demiplane for the next minute. At the end of this minute, the creature reappears in the space it left, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

When activated, gravity begins accumulating in a 30-foot-radius circle centred on the trap. The trapped area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the ranger's next turn. Each creature in the area when the trap activates must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Furthermore, each creature in the area that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.

A creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d8 force damage and be pulled 15 feet towards the trap's centre.

At the end of the ranger's next turn, the gravity reaches a critical mass and each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature is knocked prone, pulled to the trap's centre, and takes 6d8 force damage. On a success, a creature isn't knocked prone or moved, and takes half as much force damage.
