# README


## About

We have been a dedicated group of D&D fans who manually added XML for Lion's Den Fight Club 5e and Game Master 5e apps. We've now found a reliable source to auto-generate the XML, and we'll be transitioning to that completely by 2021.

If you'd like to try out the new format, you can import the "Everything" collection. If you have feedback, follow the instructions in [Issues](#Issues).

We are unaffiliated with Lion's Den and Wizards of the Coast.


## How-To

Import only one of the Collection files into the Fight Club app.

**Everything**: Newly formatted XML that includes all rulebooks, supplements, adventures, Unearthed Arcana, and some unofficial content.

**CoreRulebooks**: Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual

**CoreRulebooksAndSupplements**: _CoreRulebooks_ plus Rulebook Supplements (XGtE, MToF, VGtM, SCAG, GGtR, WGtE, ERftLW, AI, EGtW, MFF, Tortle Package, One Grung Above, MOoT)

**CoreOnly**: _CoreRulebooksAndSupplements_ plus Adventures

**CorePlusHomebrew-NoUA**: _CoreOnly_ plus homebrew, which includes the Blood Hunter class and Gunslinger subclass for Fighter

**CorePlusUnreleasedUA**: _CoreOnly_ plus unreleased Unearthed Arcana

**CorePlusUA-NoHomebrew**: _CoreOnly_ plus all Unearthed Arcana

**Complete**: _CorePlusUA-NoHomebrew_ plus homebrew and third party content
