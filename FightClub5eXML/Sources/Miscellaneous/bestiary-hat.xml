Doric magically transforms into a Beast with a challenge rating of 3 or less or into an owlbear (see the Monster Manual). Doric can remain in that form for up to 2 hours.

She can revert to her true form using a bonus action.

While Doric is transformed, her stat block is replaced by the stat block of that form, except she keeps her current hit points, her hit point maximum, this bonus action, her alignment, and her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.</text>
