    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Poised between the worlds of the living and the dead, dhampirs retain their grip on life yet are endlessly tested by vicious hungers. Their ties to the undead grant dhampirs a taste of a vampire's deathless prowess in the form of increased speed, darkvision, and a life-draining bite.

With unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs become adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who'd tempt their hunger.

    <trait>
      <name>Dhampir Hungers</name>
      <text>Every dhampir knows a thirst slaked only by the living. This desire is a whisper in the mind, a tinge to the sight, a reflex constantly needing to be suppressed. Those who overindulge their thirst risk losing control and forever viewing others as prey. Those who resist might find exceptional ways of controlling their urges or suppress it through constant, molar-grinding restraint. In any case, temptation haunts dhampirs, and circumstances conspire to give them endless reasons to indulge.

While many dhampirs thirst for blood, your character might otherwise gain sustenance from the living. Roll on or choose an option from the Dhampir Hungers table to determine what tempts your character to feed.

Dhampir Hungers:
d8 — Hunger
1 — Blood
2 — Flesh or raw meat
3 — Cerebral spinal fluid
4 — Esoteric humors
5 — Psychic energy
6 — A color from one's appearance
7 — Dreams
8 — Life energy

      <name>Dhampir Origins</name>
      <text>Dhampirs often arise from encounters with vampires, but all manner of macabre bargains, necromantic influences, and encounters with mysterious immortals might have transformed your character. The Dhampir Origins table provides suggestions for how your character gained their lineage.
         
Dhampir Origins:
d8 — Origin
1 — You are the reincarnation of an ancestor who was a vampiric tyrant.
2 — Your pact with a predatory deity, fiend, fey, or spirit causes you to share their hunger.
3 — You survived being attacked by a vampire but were forever changed.
4 — A parasite inhabits your body. You indulge your hunger to sate it.
5 — You loved an immortal and were willing to be transformed into a vampire to join them, but tragedy interrupted the transformation.
6 — You are a diminished manifestation of an otherworldly being. Slaking your hunger hastens your renewal.
7 — You don't know your origins, but you were raised by vampires or other monsters.
8 — A radical experiment changed your body, making you reliant on others for vital fluids.</text>

      <text>If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.

 If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficency in two skills of your choice

    <trait>
      <name>Vampiric Bite</name>
      <text>Your fanged bite is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with your bite. Your bite deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite. When you use your bite and hit a creature that isn't a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice:

	• Regain hit points equal to the damage dealt by the bite
	• Gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the damage dealt by the bite

You can empower yourself with your bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest

    <trait>
      <name>Revenant Subrace</name>
      <text>Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

The Revenant subrace can be applied to any race that has a subrace, and replaces that race's existing subrace options. Alternatively, you can apply this new subrace to a race without subrace options using the modification options provided below.

Your DM might also allow you to take this subrace for a slain character. In that case, your character rises from the dead with its original subrace replaced (or with the necessary modifications made to its base traits), filled with a determination to seek vengeance or complete its mission.
</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Racial Adjustments</name>
      <text>For races that don't have subrace options, taking on the Revenant subrace means making changes to your character's base traits, as follows. (This playtest article provides options only for human and dragonborn characters. Any other races which do not have subrace options should not be used with these Revenant subrace rules.)

Human Revenant:
If you want to play a human revenant, modify the human's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. If you use the variant human traits, remove the Skills trait and the Feat trait.

Dragonborn Revenant:
If you want to play a dragonborn revenant, modify the dragonborn's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Additionally, your Draconic Ancestry trait uses necrotic damage as its damage type, replacing the damage type that applies to your breath weapon and your damage resistance.
</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Relentless Nature</name>
      <text>Your DM assigns a goal to you—typically, one related to your character's death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:

	• If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.

	• If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.

	• You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.

When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life.

      <text>The dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

      <name>Life Span</name>
      <text>Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.
</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.

    <trait>
      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d8
Height = 5 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches
Weight in pounds = 175 + (2d6 × your size modifier)
</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Draconic Ancestry</name>
      <text>You have draconic ancestry. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by having become a revenant. Your damage type is Necrotic, and your breath weapon is 5 by 30 ft. line. (Dex. save)
</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Breath Weapon</name>
      <text>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Damage Resistance</name>
      <text>You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

      <text>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs — these common threads unite all dwarves.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.

Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren't necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.

Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.

Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.

Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water.

      <text>Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors.

      <text>Your DM assigns a goal to you—typically, one related to your character's death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:

	• If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.

	• If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.

	• You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.

      <text>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies. Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart's desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag's influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in wild shades, lengthy hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as long life, darkvision, and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same.

While many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them.

      <name>Heir of Hags</name>
      <text>One way hags create more of their kind is through the creation of hexbloods. Every hexblood exhibits features suggestive of the hag whose magic inspires their powers. This includes an unusual crown, often called a "eldercross" or "witch's turn."" This living, garland-like part of a hexblood's body extends from their temples and wraps behind the head, serving as a visible mark of the bargain between hag and hexblood, a debt owed, or a change to come.
</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Becoming a Hag</name>
      <text>Hags can undertake a ritual to irreversibly transform a hexblood they created into a new hag, either one of their own kind or that embodies the hexblood's nature. This requires that both the hag and hexblood be in the same place and consent to the lengthy ritual— circumstances most hexbloods shun but might come to accept over the course of centuries. Once a hexblood undergoes this irreversible ritual, they emerge as a hag NPC no longer under the control of the hexblood's player, unless the DM rules otherwise.

Hexblood Origins:
d8 — Origin
1 — Seeking a child, your parent made a bargain with a hag. You are the result of that arrangement.
2 — Fey kidnappers swapped you and your parents' child.
3 — A coven of hags lost one of their members. You were created to replace the lost hag.
4 — You were cursed as a child. A deal with the spirits of the forest transformed you into a hexblood, now free of the curse.
5 — You began life as a fey creature, but an accident or crime changed you and forced you from your home.
6 — A slighted druid transformed you and bound you to live only so long as a sacred tree bears fruit.
7 — You made a deal with a hag, but they twisted your words and transformed you.
8 — You are a child of the wilds. Animals and mysterious whispers were the only family you ever knew.

      <name>Magic Token</name>
      <text>As an action, you can harmlessly pull out one of your nails, a tooth, or a lock of hair. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued in this way, you can use an action to send a telepathic message to the creature holding or carrying the token, as long as you are on the same plane of existence and are within 10 miles of it. The message can contain up to twenty-five words.

In addition, while you are within 10 miles of the token, you can use an action to enter a trance for 1 minute, during which you can see and hear from the token as if you were located where it is. While you are using your senses at the token's location, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. Afterward, the token is harmlessly destroyed.

Once you create a token using this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, at which point your missing part regrows.

Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade.

Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.

The tieflings connected to Nessus command the power of fire and darkness, guided by a keener than normal intellect, as befits those linked to Asmodeus himself.

Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.

Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.

Lost Memories:
d8 — Memory
1 — You recall a physically painful moment. What mark or scar on your body does it relate to?
2 — A memory causes you to shed a tear. Is it a bitter or cheerful memory? Does recalling it make you feel the same way?
3 — You recall a childhood memory. What about that event or who you were still influences you?
4 — A memory brings with it the voice of someone once close to you. How do they advise you?
5 — You recall enjoying something that you can't stand doing now. What is it? Why don't you like it now?
6 — A memory carries a vivid smell or sensation. What are you going to do to recreate that experience?
7 — You faintly remember a place that couldn't possibly exist. What is this vision? How does it make you feel?
