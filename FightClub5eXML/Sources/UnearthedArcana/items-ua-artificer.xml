    <text>An Alchemist's Satchel is a bag of reagents that you use to create a variety of concoctions. The bag and its contents are both magical, and this magic allows you to pull out exactly the right materials you need for your Alchemical Formula options. After you use one of those options, the bag reclaims the materials.</text>
    <text />
    <text>If you lose this satchel, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of leather, glass, and other raw materials.</text>
