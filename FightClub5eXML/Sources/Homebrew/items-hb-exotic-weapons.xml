    <text>A broad, flat club, with a thin grip extending from its base. May have holes drilled through its broadside, to reduce resistance when swung that way. Designed to disperse force as much as possible, causing significant pain, but can also be swung edgewise to cause actual damage to tissue and bone.

    <text>A stiff, flexible material, (leather or rubber) sometimes filled with a weight, such as steel balls, in the form of a club. These are almost always flat in shape, to spread out the force across a larger area. Due to the flexibility of the material, it causes more pain and tissue damage than a stiffer weapon like a normal club. They are less likely to break a bone. They deliver significantly more shock to the brain if a person's head is struck, and can easily cause irreversible brain damage.

    <text>A policeman's club, typically composed of wood or metal, less than an arm's length. (3ft or less) These often had a small guard and ridged grip turned (lathed) from their original blank/stock, and in older periods were emblazoned with the officer's seal of office or authority. Some are designed with a side-handle, like a Tonfa, which are sometimes called "night-sticks". Some of these may have the side handle attached by threading, like a bolt, allowing it to be converted to a standard truncheon at will. Many have a leather strap or loop extending from the butt of the grip. Though this was intended to wrap around the wrist to prevent disarming, creative people found other, less benign uses for the strap.

    <text>A weapon which consists of several metal rods, which are joined end-to-end by rings to form a flexible chain. Generally, the whip has a handle at one end and a metal dart, used for slashing or piercing an opponent, at the other. A cloth flag is often attached at or near the dart end of the whip and a second flag may cover the whip's handle. The flag or flags adds visual appeal and produces a rushing sound as the whip swings through the air. They also help stabilize the whip, enhancing the user's control. This reduces the risk of the user inadvertently striking themselves. The rushing noise also helps the user with identifying the location of the other end, since the weapon moves too fast to be normally noticed by human eyes.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
