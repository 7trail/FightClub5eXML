      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Intelligent and curious beings, Smutsia are eager to explore and figure out all sorts of things. Smutsia are mammals and can at most birth one child a year. When a Smutsia is approaching maturity, it is sent ut to explore more of the world and find new places to live. All Smutsia are monogamous and have one partner for life, which they may have many children with over their lifetime. 

Having lived mostly in burrows and explored during the night, most Smutsia are somewhat afraid of direct sunlight as they don't know what it might do to them.
