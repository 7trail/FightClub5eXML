      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Intelligent and curious beings, Smutsia are eager to explore and figure out all sorts of things. Smutsia are mammals and can at most birth one child a year. When a Smutsia is approaching maturity, it is sent ut to explore more of the world and find new places to live. All Smutsia are monogamous and have one partner for life, which they may have many children with over their lifetime. 

Having lived mostly in burrows and explored during the night, most Smutsia are somewhat afraid of direct sunlight as they don't know what it might do to them.

      <text>The Mousefolk have a deep love of art, literature, song, and craft, and will often spend a lifetime perfecting their trade. True masterworks are rarely seen by the outside world, instead they are preserved and passed through the generations. To be a keeper of lore and heritage is among the highest honors and greatest responsibilities in Mousefolk culture.

The Mousefolk who do not end up learning a trade will often put their skills to use pursuing esoteric knowledge, training as defenders, spiritual leaders, rangers, covert agents, or they might even travel the world as an adventurer-for-hire.

Virtuous And Headstrong:
Despite their generally flighty appearance, mousefolk are a very honorable people. They believe strongly in personal honor, less so in the idea that the actions of others can impugn that honor. When a mousefolk makes a mistake, especially one that causes harm to others, they will work hard and at long lengths to correct that mistake.

Mousefolk Names:
When a Mousefolk is old enough to read, they are taken by an elder to the clan's archives to study the lore and histories of their people. After several years, the individual is allowed to pick their own name, either adopting the name of a past hero, or inventing a new name for themselves.
