Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature grappled by the plant. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) acid damage, and the target is pulled into the plant's space and enveloped by the pod, and the grapple ends.

While enveloped, the target is restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and effects originating outside the pod. The enveloped target must also immediately succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned by the plant's sapping enzymes until it is removed from the pod or the plant dies. The enveloped target doesn't require air and gains 1 level of exhaustion for each hour it spends in the pod. If the target dies while enveloped, it immediately emerges from the pod as a living podling, wearing or carrying all of the original creature's equipment. As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the bodytaker plant that is outside the pod can open the pod and pull the target free with a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the plant dies, the target is no longer restrained and can escape from the pod by spending 10 feet of movement, exiting prone. The plant has one pod, which can envelop one creature at a time.</text>

Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the carrion stalker attaches to the target and pulls itself into the target's space.

While attached, the carrion stalker moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it. A creature can use its action to try to detach the carrion stalker and force it to move into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful DC 11 Strength check. On its turn, the carrion stalker can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement. When it dies, the carrion stalker detaches from any creature it is attached to.</text>

The carrion stalker releases a burst of larvae in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns as larvae infest its body. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any effect that cures disease or removes the poisonedcondition instantly kills the larvae in the creature, ending the effect on it. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the infestation, it dies. The larvae remain in the corpse, and one survives to become a fully grown carrion stalker in 1d4 weeks. Any effect that cures diseases or removes the poisoned condition that targets the corpse instantly kills the larvae.</text>

The carrionette targets a creature it can see within 15 feet of it that is cursed by its Silver Needle. Unless the target is protected by a protection from evil and good spell, it must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have its consciousness swapped with the carrionette. The carrionette gains control of the target's body, and the target is unconsciousfor 1 hour, after which it gains control of the carrionette's body. While controlling the target's body, the carrionette retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
If the carrionette's body is destroyed, both the carrionette and the target die. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the controlled body drives the carrionette out and returns the consciousness of both creatures to their original bodies. The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the carrionette's Silver Needle.</text>

      <name>Headless Summoning (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</name>
      <text>
If the dullahan is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains 97 hit points. In addition, it summons three death's heads, one of each type, in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of it. The death's heads are under the dullahan's control and act immediately after the dullahan in the initiative order. Additionally, the dullahan can now use the options in the "Mythic Actions" section. Award a party an additional 5,900 XP (11,800 XP total) for defeating the dullahan after it uses Headless Summoning</text>

The target dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature that doesn't have or need a head, or has legendary actions, instead takes an extra 27 (6d8) slashing damage.</text>

In beast form, it retains its hit points but otherwise uses the stat block of the beast it is imitating. When it dies, the gingwatzim reverts to its true form and then vanishes.</text>

      <name>Unearthly Bile (Recharge 5–6)</name>
      <text>
The emissary expels bile that splashes all creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of the emissary. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For each creature that fails the saving throw, a gibbering mouther (see its entry in the Monster Manual) appears in an unoccupied space on a surface that can support it within 30 feet of that creature. The gibbering mouthers act right after the emissary on the same initiative count, gaining a +7 bonus to their attack and damage rolls, and fighting until they are destroyed. They disappear when the emissary dies.</text>

      <text>
The emissary causes the ground in a 20-foot square that it can see within 90 feet of it to turn into teeth and maws until the start of its next turn. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. Any creature takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage for each 5 feet it moves on this terrain.</text>

      <name>Mind Cloud (Costs 3 Actions)</name>
      <text>
The emissary unleashes a psychic wave. Each creature within 30 feet of the emissary must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 32 (5d12) psychic damage.

In addition, every spell ends on creatures and objects of the emissary's choice in that area.</text>

Immediately after a creature within 30 feet of the gremishka casts a spell, the gremishka can spontaneously react to the magic. Roll a d6 to determine the effect:

1–2. The gremishka emanates magical energy. Each creature within 30 feet of the gremishka must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) force damage.
3–4. The gremishka surges with magical energy and regains 3 (1d6) hit points.
5–6. The gremishka explodes and dies, and one swarm of gremishkas instantly appears in the space where this gremishka died. The swarm uses the gremishka's initiative.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
      <text>
The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Mimicry</name>

    <trait>
      <name>Shared Spellcasting</name>
      <text>
While all three members of the Fetid Gaze are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

	• 1st level (4 slots): charm person, witch bolt

	• 2nd level (3 slots): alter self, suggestion

	• 3rd level (3 slots): dispel magic, glyph of warding, slow

	• 4th level (3 slots): blight, polymorph

	• 5th level (2 slots): dominate person, seeming

	• 6th level (1 slot): Otto's irresistible dance

For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
      <text>
A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

      <name>Illusory Appearance.</name>
      <text>
The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</text>
    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Invisible Passage</name>
      <text>
The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.</text>

The jiangshi has the following flaws: Fear of Its Own Reflection. If the jiangshi sees its own reflection, it immediately uses its reaction, if available, to move as far away from the reflection as possible. Susceptible to Holy Symbols.

      <name>Consume Energy</name>
      <text>
The jiangshi draws energy from a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The jiangshi regains hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt. After regaining hit points from this action, the jiangshi gains the following benefits for 7 days: its walking speed increases to 40 feet, and it gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed and can hover.
A Humanoid slain by this necrotic damage rises as a wight (see its entry in the Monster Manual) at the end of the jiangshi's turn. The wight acts immediately after the jiangshi in the initiative order. If this wight slays a Humanoid with its Life Drain, the wight transforms into a jiangshi 5 days later.</text>

      <text>
Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.</text>

If the target isn't a Construct or an Undead, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or the necrichor enters the target's space and attaches itself to the target for 1 minute. While attached, the necrichor takes only half damage dealt to it (round down), and the target takes the remaining damage.

The necrichor can attach to only one creature at a time. The attached necrichor can telepathically control the target's move, action, or both. When controlled this way, the target can take only the Attack action (necrichor chooses the target) or the Dash action. The attached target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, detaching from the necrichor and forcing it to move into the nearest unoccupied space on a success.</text>

If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the nosferatu regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

Any creature swallowed by a parasite-infested behir must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the behir's turns or be feasted upon by blood parasites, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. This damage is in addition to the damage caused by the behir's digestive acids.

If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

Flying Stone. The target takes 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage and is incapacitated until the start of the juggernaut's next turn, and the implement vanishes.
Scything Shrapnel. The target takes 14 (4d6) slashing damage, and the implement vanishes.

At the start of each of its turns, the target takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage from the wound left by the shrapnel. The wound ends if the target regains any hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</text>

Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage.

If the target is a creature, it suffers a lingering wound that causes it to take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Each time the slasher hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 (1d6). The wound ends if the target regains hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</text>

The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

The strigoi magically summons 1d4 + 2 stirges (see their entry in the Monster Manual) in unoccupied spaces it can see within 30 feet of it. The stirges are under the strigoi's control and act immediately after the strigoi in the initiative order. The stirges disappear after 1 hour, when the strigoi dies, or when the strigoi dismisses them (no action required).</text>

Each time the diseased creature finishes a long rest, roll a d6 to determine the disease's effect:

1–2. The creature is blinded until it finishes a long rest.
3–4. The creature's hit point maximum decreases by 5 (2d4), and the reduction can't be removed until the disease ends. The creature dies if its hit point maximum drops to 0.
5–6. The creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until it finishes its next long rest. The disease lasts until it's removed by magic or until the creature rolls the same random effect for the disease two long rests in a row.</text>
