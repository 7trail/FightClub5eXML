            <text>When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature, Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.</text>

            <text>4 | There's nothing I like more than a good mystery.</text>
            <text>5 | I'm willing to listen to every side of an argument before I make my own judgment.</text>

            <text>3 | Logic. Emotions must not cloud our logical thinking. (Lawful)</text>
            <text>4 | No Limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. (Chaotic)</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Feature: Ballad of the Grinning Fool</name>
            <text>Like every Grinner, you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the "Ballad of the Grinning Fool" in a major tavern or inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM's discretion.</text>
            <text>This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.</text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
            <text>Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creates a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny.</text>
            <text>d8 | Personality Trait</text>

            <text>5 | I can't sit still.</text>
            <text>6 | I'm always humming an old tune from my past.</text>

            <text></text>
            <text>d6 | Ideal</text>
            <text>1 | Revolution. Tyrants must fall, no matter the cost. (Chaotic)</text>
            <text>2 | Compassion. The only way to make a better world is to perform small kindnesses. (Good)</text>
            <text>3 | Justice. A nation built upon just foundations will uphold freedom for all. (Law)</text>
            <text>4 | Expression. Music, joy, and laughter are the keys to freedom. (Good)</text>
            <text>5 | Self-Determination. People should be free to do as they please. (Chaotic)</text>
            <text>6 | Vigilance. A free people must be carefully taught, lest they be misled. (Neutral)</text>
            <text></text>
            <text>d6 | Bond</text>
            <text>1 | I lost someone important to an agent of the Dwendalian Empire. That regime will fall.</text>
            <text>2 | The first people to be hurt by this war will be the common folk. I need to protect them.</text>
            <text>3 | Music helped me through a dark time in my life. Now, I'll use music to change the world.</text>
            <text>4 | I will be known as the greatest spy who ever lived.</text>

            <text>2 | I do everything big! Subtlety? I don't know the meaning of subtlety! Oh, that's a problem?</text>
            <text>3 | Being a spy in wartime is painful. I've seen so much suffering, I think I'm losing my mind.</text>
            <text>4 | I can't focus on my mission. I just want to carouse and sing and play!</text>
            <text>5 | Yeah, that's my name. Yeah, I'm a Grinner spy. Who cares about staying undercover?</text>
            <text>6 | I can't afford to trust anyone. Not. Anyone.</text>

        <trait>
            <name>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful</name>
            <text>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</text>
            <text>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</text>
        </trait>
        <trait>
            <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
            <text>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.
                <text>d8 | Personality Trait</text>
                <text>1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.</text>
                <text>2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.</text>
                <text>3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.</text>
                <text>4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.</text>
                <text>5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.</text>
                <text>6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.</text>
                <text>7 | I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me.</text>
                <text>8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.</text>

                <text>d6 | Ideal</text>

                <text>3 | Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)</text>

                <name>Feature: Ship's Passage</name>
                <text>When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.</text>

                <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
                <text>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.</text>
                <text>d8 | Personality Trait</text>
                <text>1 | My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.</text>
                <text>2 | I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.</text>
                <text>3 | I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale.</text>
                <text>4 | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.</text>
                <text>5 | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.</text>
                <text>6 | I never pass up a friendly wager.</text>
                <text>7 | My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.</text>
                <text>8 | I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it.</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>d6 | Ideal</text>
                <text>1 | Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good)</text>
                <text>2 | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)</text>
                <text>3 | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)</text>
                <text>4 | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)</text>
                <text>5 | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)</text>
                <text>6 | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>d6 | Bond</text>
                <text>1 | I'm loyal to my captain first, everything else second.</text>
                <text>2 | The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.</text>
                <text>3 | I'll always remember my first ship.</text>
                <text>4 | In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.</text>
                <text>5 | I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.</text>
                <text>6 | Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine.</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>d6 | Flaw</text>
                <text>1 | I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong.</text>
                <text>2 | I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.</text>
                <text>3 | Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation.</text>
                <text>4 | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.</text>
                <text>5 | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.</text>
                <text>6 | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.</text>

            <trait>
                <name>Feature: Shadow Network</name>
                <text>You have access to the Volstrucker shadow network, which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to.</text>
                <text>The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page.</text>
            </trait>
            <trait>
                <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
                <text>Agents of the Volstrucker are groomed to follow orders without question and to kill without mercy. The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a Volstrucker agent's assignments. Officially, no one ever leaves the order—but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom.</text>
                <text>d6 | Personality Trait</text>
                <text>1 | I prefer to keep my thoughts to myself.</text>
                <text>2 | I indulge vice in excess to quiet my conscience.</text>
                <text>3 | I've left emotion behind me. I'm now perfectly placid.</text>
                <text>4 | Some event from the past keeps worming its way into my mind, making me restless.</text>
                <text>5 | I always keep my word—except when I'm commanded to break it.</text>
                <text>6 | I laugh off insults and never take them personally.</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>d6 | Ideal</text>
                <text>1 | Order. The will of the crown is absolute. (Law)</text>
                <text>2 | True Loyalty. The Cerberus Assembly is greater than any power, even the crown. (Law)</text>
                <text>3 | Death. The penalty for disloyalty is death. (Evil)</text>
                <text>4 | Determination. I cannot fail. Not ever. (Neutral)</text>
                <text>5 | Fear. People should not respect power. They should fear it. (Evil)</text>
                <text>6 | Escape. The Volstrucker are pure evil! I can't atone for what I've done for them, but I can escape with my life. (Any)</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>d4 | Bond</text>
                <text>1 | The job is all that matters. I will see it through.</text>
                <text>2 | My orders are important, but my comrades are worth more than anything. I would die for them.</text>
                <text>3 | Everything I've done, I've done to protect someone close to me.</text>
                <text>4 | If the empire falls, all of civilization falls with it. I will hold back chaos and barbarism at any cost.</text>
                <text></text>
                <text>d4 | Flaw</text>
                <text>1 | I drink to dull the pain in the back of my head.</text>
                <text>2 | I go a bit mad when I see blood.</text>
                <text>3 | I can hear the voices of everyone I've killed. I see their faces. I can't be free of these ghosts.</text>
                <text>4 | Fear is a powerful motivator. I will do whatever it takes to prevent those who know what I am from seeing me fail, and from those I care about from knowing what I am.</text>
