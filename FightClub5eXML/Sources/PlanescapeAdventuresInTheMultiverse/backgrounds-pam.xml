d6 | Personality Trait
1 | Strange events and otherworldly creatures don't faze me.
2 | I think in terms of exchange: something for something, nothing for nothing.
3 | I speak with an unusual cadence.
4 | I pepper my speech with borrowed words or curses borrowed from planar languages.
5 | I've seen enough to know that you can't take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone I deal with.
6 | I have a superstitious habit I picked up from my gate-town, such as touching iron when I'm nervous or arranging objects in a specific order.

      <name>Factions of Sigil</name>
      <text>Twelve factions have risen to prominence in the City of Doors, though many more exist. Your character might belong to one of these groups or another ideological faction, perhaps one of your own creation.

The primary factions of Sigil adhere to the following philosophies:

Athar:
Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power.

Bleak Cabal:
There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning.

Doomguard:
Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay.

Fated:
Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold.

Fraternity of Order:
All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them.

Hands of Havoc:
Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail.

Harmonium:
The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is acting in harmony, whether it wants to or not.

Heralds of Dust:
Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence.

Mercykillers:
Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it.

Mind's Eye:
The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn.

Society of Sensation:
Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity.

Transcendent Order:
Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone.

1 | I don't venerate any gods. With time, we can be as powerful as them or greater.
2 | Experience is everything; live in the moment.
3 | When things crumble, I find meaning in the dust.
4 | Life thrives through order, and I seek to maintain that order.
5 | When others make plans, the multiverse laughs and so do I.
